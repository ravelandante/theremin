-   make ok gesture recognition more robust (use finger distances)
-   make right hand y control octave instead of note (maybe)
-   refactor to use finger enum instead of indices
-   add polyphonic mode where left hand controls a separate pitch
-   add more controls for the left fingers (maybe with gestures)
-   add GH demo
-   host?
-   MIDI keyboard integration as more of an expression controller
-   UI
