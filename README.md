# Theremin

## TODO

-   make finger bend thresholds relative to hand size
-   make ok gesture recognition more robust (use finger distances)
-   limit volume control to a smaller y range on the image
-   make right hand y control octave instead of note (maybe)
-   refactor to use finger enum instead of indices
-   add polyphonic mode where left hand controls a separate pitch
-   add more controls for the left fingers (maybe with gestures)
